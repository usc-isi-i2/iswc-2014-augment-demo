The user then clicks on  E21\_Person1 in the \rtworml mapping and selects Augment Data to discover new data to integrate into artist records.  
\karma retrieves \rtworml mappings in its repository that describe crm:E21\_Person, and uses these mappings to generate a candidate set of linked data sources to integrate, identifies meaningful object and data properties, and presents them to the user as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:search-screenshot}.
To help the users select properties to integrate, Karma uses Bloom filters to estimate the number of artists that have each of the properties listed in Figure~\ref{fig:search-screenshot}.
