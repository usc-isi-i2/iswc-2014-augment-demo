For our demonstration we will integrate a CSV file containing 197 artists with Linked Data published by the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM). 
In previous work~\cite{Szekely:2013vq}, we mapped the SAAM dataset, including over 40,000 artworks and 8,000 artists to the CIDOC CRM ontology~\cite{Doerr:2003:CCR:958671.958678} using \rtworml and made it accessible by a SPARQL endpoint, along with a repository for the \rtworml mappings.
The SAAM LOD here is a proxy for the Linked Data cloud to illustrate the vision of a Linked Data cloud populated with \rtworml models.
