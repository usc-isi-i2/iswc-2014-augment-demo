\begin{enumerate}
\item CSV file from a museum, containing 197 artists. 
\item Linked Data published by the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM), including over 40,000 artworks and 8,000 artists accessible by a SPARQL endpoint. 
In previous work~\cite{Szekely:2013vq} ~\todo{cite saam-lod github} we mapped the SAAM dataset to the CIDOC CRM ontology~\cite{Doerr:2003:CCR:958671.958678} using \rtworml.
In the demonstration, the SAAM LOD is a proxy for the Linked Data cloud to illustrate the vision of a Linked Data cloud populated with \rtworml models.
\item \rtworml repository containing \rtworml mappings from the Web and made accessible by a \sparql endpoint (separate from the Linked Data endpoint).
\end{enumerate}
