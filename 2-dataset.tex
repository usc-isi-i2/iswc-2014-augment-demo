One museum who has used Karma for both modeling their data and generating RDF is the Smithsonian American Art Museum \cite{Szekely:2013vq}. 
The model process for their source data required mapping 14 tables and views from their content management system which was backed by a relational database.
For the mapping, the Smithsonian relied on the CIDOC CRM ontology \cite{Doerr:2003:CCR:958671.958678}.

For this demonstration, we will use a CSV file containing approximately 200 artists extracted from 2500 records of artworks held at another museum.
We will show how a user can interactively develop a source model for this new dataset, discover what the Smithsonian has generated in relation to the user's new source model, and then integrate the Smithsonian's data into their own.  
To facilitate the discovery and integration, we have also generated a set of owl:sameAs links between the artists in the new dataset and the artists from the Smithsonian dataset using LIMES \cite{ngomo2011limes}.
