We see similarities in our approach with those used in relational database integration and semantic service composition.  
ORCHESTRA\cite{ives2008orchestra} starts, like \rtworml, by aligning database tables to a schema graph.  
For integration, heuristics are used to translate keyword searches over the graph into join paths using its Q query system. 
However, these joins are not guaranteed to be semantically meaningful, unlike the integration paths \karma finds using \rtworml.

Platforms such as iServe\cite{pedrinaci2010iserve} aim to capture Linked Services and make them discoverable and queryable by annotating them with their Minimal Service Model using an editor.
We have also repurposed \rtworml to capture service descriptions in Karma\cite{taheriyan12:lapis}, which means we can also enable our users to compose such services with other data sources.
