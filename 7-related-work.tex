We see similarities in our approach with those used in relational database integration and semantic service composition.  
ORCHESTRA\cite{ives2008orchestra} starts, like \rtworml, by aligning database tables to a schema graph.  
For integration, heuristics are used to translate keyword searches over the graph into join paths using its Q query system. 
However, these joins are not guaranteed to be semantically meaningful, unlike the integration paths \karma finds using \rtworml.

Platforms such as iServe\cite{pedrinaci2010iserve} capture Linked Services and make them discoverable and queryable by annotating them with their Minimal Service Model.  However, the past work on service discovery and composition only uses a semantic model of the inputs and outputs of the services.  In contrast, \karma service descriptions~\cite{taheriyan12:lapis} also capture the relationship between the attributes, which allows us to automatically discover semantically meaningful joins.
