By building on Karma's ability to quickly model many source types, we have demonstrated how museum curators can identify other linked museum data sources, identify relevant, available biographical attributes for their artists, handle linking their artists to those other sources, and then integrate the data from those sources into their own dataset. 
Through this source discovery and integration, the museum curator can transparently compose and join other museums' sources and services in a meaningful, interactive way not previously possible.
