The user selects the artist's biography (for completeness) and birth (for validation). Karma automatically constructs SPARQL queries for the data.
To facilitate integration, we generated owl:sameAs links between the artists using LIMES \cite{ngomo2011limes}.  
We plan to support the linking in Karma.
Karma then merges the results and updates the mapping shown in Figure~\ref{fig:augment-screenshot}, so the user can continue to explore the integrated data interactively.
