The user begins by using \karma's existing capability to model the artists in the CSV file as crm:E21\_Person in an \rtworml mapping shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simple-model-screenshot}.  
\karma can use this mapping to generate RDF,  
and can also compare it to retrieve other mappings, discovering new related sources that can be integrated with the artist dataset.
