The user begins by using Karma's existing capability to model the artists in the CSV file as crm:E21\_Person in an R2RML mapping shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simple-model-screenshot}.  
Karma can use this mapping to generate RDF. 
Karma can also compare it to the other mappings to discover new related sources that can be used to integrate with.
