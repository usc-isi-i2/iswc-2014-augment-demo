We begin by using Karma's existing capability to capture the artists in the first CSV file as crm:E21\_Person from the CIDOC CRM ontology in a source model shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simple-model-screenshot}.  
Karma can translate this model into an R2RML mapping.
Karma can then compare it to the other mappings loaded in the Model Manager to discover new ways to integrate data.
